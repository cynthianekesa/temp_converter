# Temperature Conversion App 

## About The Project
This is a simple temperature converter app that converts temperature from Celcius to Fahrenheit and from Fahrenheit to Celcius only. It is a school assignment for my 2.3 tri semester at the African Leadership University. The end goal is to practice the content taught in class, such as state management, widgets, etc.
